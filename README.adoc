This tool is intended to:

. Get all available EC2 instances and get the used AMI
. Get all owned AMI's
. Filter out AMI's which are currently used bei EC2 instances
. Delete all AMI's which are older then the specified duration (default is 7 days)

== Usage

=== Preqrequisites

amiclean uses already provided credentials in ~/.aws/credentials also it uses the central configuration in ~/.aws/config!


=== Examples
`amiclean` scan all AMIs owned by self and delete them if they are unused and older then 7 days.             

`amiclean --account 2451251` scan all AMIs of self and were AWS account 2451251 are owner

`amiclean --dry-run` do not delete anything just show what you would do

`amiclean --older-then 5w` delete all images which are older then 5w and are unused

== Development

=== Generate mock using mockery

In order to test the ec2client I used link:https://github.com/vektra/mockery[mockery] to create the mocks:

[source,sh]
----
cd internal
mockery --name Ec2client --with-expecter
----
